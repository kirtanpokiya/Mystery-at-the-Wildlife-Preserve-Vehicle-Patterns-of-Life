**Introduction**

Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve is a large protected area known for its rich biodiversity, including the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit, a bird species whose population has been declining. Understanding the traffic patterns within the preserve is crucial for identifying potential impacts on wildlife and developing strategies to mitigate these effects. This project aims to analyze vehicle traffic data to uncover patterns of life by vehicles traveling through the park.

**Purpose of the Project**

Understanding vehicle patterns within the Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve is crucial for wildlife conservation. By identifying key patterns and their impacts, we can develop strategies to protect the park's biodiversity while managing visitor activities.

**Research Questions**

● Describe up to six daily patterns of life by vehicles traveling through and within the park. Characterize the patterns by describing the kinds of vehicles participating, their spatial activities, their temporal activities, and provide a hypothesis of what the pattern represents .

● Describe up to six patterns of life that occur over multiple days by vehicles traveling through and within the park. Characterize the patterns by describing the kinds of vehicles participating, their spatial activities, their temporal activities, and provide a hypothesis of what the pattern represents

**Description of the Dataset**

The primary data source is the traffic sensor data collected by park rangers.
The dataset contains the following information:

● Timestamp: The date and time when a vehicle passed a sensor.

● Car-id: A unique identifier for each vehicle.

● Car-type: The type of vehicle (e.g., 2P for park service vehicles, 4 for 4-axle
trucks, etc.).

● Gate-name: The identifier for the sensor location where the vehicle was detected.

■ Entrances - All vehicles pass through an Entrance when entering or leaving the Preserve.

■ General-gates - All vehicles may pass through these gates.

■ Gates - These are gates that prevent general traffic from passing.
Preserve Ranger vehicles have tags that allow them to pass through these
gates to inspect or perform work on the roadway beyond.

■ Ranger-stops - These sensors represent working areas for the Rangers, so you will often see a Ranger-stop sensor at the end of a road managed by a
Gate.

■ Camping - These sensors record visitors to the Preserve camping areas. Visitors pass by these entering and exiting a campground.
